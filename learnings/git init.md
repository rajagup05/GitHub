##         git init

The `git init` command is used to initialize a new, empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one. 


### What It Does

- Creates a .git directory: This hidden folder is added to your project root. It contains all the necessary metadata, configurations, and object databases required for version control.
- Prepares tracking: It allows Git to start tracking changes to files in that directory.
- Sets the default branch: Modern Git versions typically initialize with a branch named main (older versions used master).
