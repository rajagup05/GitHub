**git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>**

> The `git remote add origin` command adds a new remote repository to your local Git repository and names it "origin". This allows you to push and pull changes between your local project and a shared remote server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. 

The general syntax for the command is:
`git remote add <name> <url>`

By convention, the name origin is used for the primary remote repository. You should replace `<url>` with the actual HTTPS or SSH URL provided by your hosting service. 

Example: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/your-repo.git`
